# Arbitrage - Crypto asset class

This how-to guide covers an example of how I've tested the arbitrage trade system.
Arbitrage systems take advantage of the price differences between different brokers/exchanges. i.e. an apply sells for R10 at company A and R15 at company B. So you buy from B, ship the apple to market A and sell it for R5 profit.

Overall, the end to end process in this guide is pretty simple. **But you need to and must stay focused and double check things as you trade.**

I'm using 2 providers that I've only just learned about through friends. Mostly because the one is running a special for September where some transaction fees are being waived; making this arbitrage system for normal folks like me, profitable.

BTC is my choice of asset right now, sinec it has good volume and so filling Buy or Sell orders isn't difficult.
The 2 brokers/crypto exchanges I'm using are crypto.com and valr.com (local SA based exchange).

If you're going to try this system out, then please register using my referral codes. For crypto.com, we both get a 50usd referral bonus. For valr.com there are transaction rebates for referrals.

Here's a birds eye view of how the system works:
### Setup things
1. You will need* R20 000 available for executing a single trade cycle.
    1. **All this comes with very high risks so make sure you're using money that you're "ok" to lose.**
    1. *\*need* -> I say 20k because my goal is to make R500 profit per cycle and 20k works well given my expected trade price conditions. More on that below.
1. Register on crypto.com and valr.com
    1. Complete KYC account verification on both (you will need your SA ID card on hand)
    1. Remember to use my referral codes by starting the process using these links so that we both get 50usd bonuses.
        1. [crypto.com - my code is ppy6hf8t2k](https://platinum.crypto.com/r/ppy6hf8t2k)
        1. [valr.com - my code is VAKQCMGE](https://www.valr.com/invite/VAKQCMGE)
        1. Valr will get through account approval much faster than crypto (hour vs 1-2 days).
    1. While your accounts are being verified, register your banking/credit card details on Valr app
  1. Once both your accounts are verified you can get started with trades.
### Trading steps
1. Check prices on both exchanges to determine if following trade conditions are valid (in my opinion, I'm on expert! :)):
  1. Check that price X at crypto.com > price Y at valr.com.
  1. Price difference must be at least R7000.
  1. BTC order book must have sufficient orders to quickly fill your Buy and Sell orders. 
      * You don't want to hold onto BTC for long periods unless you know exactly what you're doing. 
      * We're not concerned about overal market trend here, just that there's a price difference between 2 exchanges/markets.
        * This is inherently risky!
        * The other important reason for this is that you need to be confident that the you'll get your expected Sell price given the long lead time for the BTC coins reach valr.com. 
1. Buy BTC at crypto.com at price X.
    1. Verify your BUY price condition.
      1. Since you're buying BTC you should be lookng at the red coloured Seller prices.
    1. On your first purchase you will add your debit/credit card details from which to make the purchase.
1. Once your order fills, do a crypto-currency withdrawal to an external wallet (valr.com)
    1. You will need to first open the valr.com app and copy your BTC wallet address.
    1. Specify the valr.com wallet address at the receiver/destination of your crypto.com BTC withdrawal.
    1. The BTC withdrawal from crpto.com to valr.com takes rougly 15-20mins, sometimes even 30mins.
1. Sell BTC at valr.com at price Y.
    1. Verify your SELL price condition.
      1. Note at this point your trying to sell your BTC so should be looking at the green coloured Buyer prices.
    1. Use a Limit type order given you've verified that the order book has sufficient orders at your expected Sell price.
1. Once your sell order is filled, confirm that money is on your ZAR wallet.
    1. From the ZAR/Rand wallet, complete the withdrawal process.
1. You've completed 1 cycle of a trade.
    1. Now rinse and repeat.
    1. There's a weekly trade limit of R125000 currently on crypto.com.
    1. If you want to extend that, you will need to purchase crypto.com's VISA card (Ruby card is cheapest at ~R2600 as of writing this). Doing so will up your weekly limit to R250000.
    1. Be mentally prepared for some tense moments when you do your first trade. Keep calm, stay focused on your steps/plan.
        1. Also be prepared for losing your internet connection, banking system delays, apps failing and all the generall things that can go wrong. Hence, only use money you're ok with losing! I'm told a lot of retail traders simply lose all their capital in first few weeks of trading.
